Test Script for Verifying the Offline Generation and Dynamic Environment.

This script performs a single episode run to validate that:
1. The GeneratorAgent can produce a valid demand schedule.
2. The DynamicCVRPEnv can be reset with this schedule.
3. The environment correctly reveals demands from the schedule as time progresses
   during the `step` function calls.
